#Android - Grocery List App
###An Android app targeting AP16 (compatability)

###About

This project is a grocery list app for Android devices. It currently uses a grocery_list.xml file as the grocery list. Will soon be updating to use SQLite as the database.

Allows you to add new items, auto-updates the quantity of existing items, and has an "In Cart?" checkbox for each item to check if you've added the item to your shopping cart already.

####This is a really good example of my Java understanding and coding skills

###TODO:

* Make "Qty" numbers on each item clickable and editable
* Make "Item Name" fields on each item clickable and editable
* Create sort lists to sort items by name or other options
* Add "grocery type" property to GrocerItem class so each item added can be assigned to a type (i.e. meat, produce, dairy, dry, etc)
* Add delete option to each grocery item
* Add a "clear all" option to empty the grocery item list when you are finished using the current list
* Add the option to use multiple lists
